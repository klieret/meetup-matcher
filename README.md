A script to facilitate networking by matching people for meetups in small groups.

Setting up a meetup works as follows:

1. You obtain a list of email addresses of everyone interested, optionally together with availabilities and extra information
2. You run this script to match groups of three people together and to send them an email
3. Each group decides what to do, and where and when to meet on their own.

## Match-making

### Finding the right group sizes

The overwhelming majority of participants prefers groups of three and a non-negligible fraction vetos groups of two. However, the number of participants is not always divisible by three. Therefore, for sufficiently large numbers of participants, up to two groups of four are added. For very low (< 5) participants, a single group of two might be added if permitted by the vetos.

### Matching people and optimizing joint availabilities

If availabilities are surveyed in the sign-up form, then the groups are matched based on these availabilities. This means optimizing an objective function of the mutual availabilities of each group. More weight is given to avoiding groups of very low mutual availabilities.

This optimization problem reminds of the 3-dimensional version of the [stable roommates problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_roommates_problem).

Currently, the optimization is performed by sampling the possibility space with heuristic weights:

1. Take the participant of lowest availability to start a group.
2. Iteratively add participants until the group size is reached. The probability for each participant is adjusted based on the joint availability with the already existing group members. It increases with high joint availability but also decreases when the participant would "waste" a lot of their availabilities (see below).
3. Step 1-2 are repeated until all groups are formed.
4. The global cost function is calculated for all groups.
5. Steps 1-4 are repeated many times to sample the possibility space.

To be precise, the weight from step 2 is currently chosen to be

where G represents the indices of the already added group members and A denotes the availabilities as a set.

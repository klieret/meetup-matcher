A script to facilitate networking by matching people for meetups in small groups.

This works in three steps:

1. You obtain a list of email addresses of everyone interested
2. You run this script to match groups of three[^1] people together and to send them an email
3. Each group decides what to do, and where and when to meet on their own.

[^1]: Of course, depending on the number of people, you cannot have
all groups having three people. The script will add up to two groups of four people, or,
if there are very few people, one group of two people. Take a look at `_solve_numeric`
for the exact algorithm.

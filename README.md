A script to facilitate networking by matching people for meetups in small groups.

This works in three steps:

1. You obtain a list of email addresses of everyone interested
2. You run this script to match groups of three people together and to send them an email
3. Each group decides what to do, and where and when to meet on their own.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip3 install .

## Running the script



### Development setup

pip3 install -e .
gitmoji -i  # npm install gitmoji

```

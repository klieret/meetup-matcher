Dear {{ names | join(', ') }},

you have been matched to a meetup!

Here are your details:

{% for _, p in people.iterrows() -%}
* {{ p['name'] }} (email: {{ p.email }}{% if p.slack %}, slack: {{ p.slack }}{% endif %})
{% endfor %}

{% if availabilities is not none -%}
You are all available at the following times:
{% for a in availabilities -%}
* {{ a }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

You are now supposed to meet up in the week specified in the invitation. You can go out for tea, coffee, have lunch, take a walk, or do anything else you like.

Please click "reply all", remove the meetup matcher email address, and suggest a few dates/times to your group (or use slack for the same). Alternatively you can also use a website like https://crab.fit/ to settle on the dates/times (the next iteration of the meetup matcher will likely already have a similar feature included).

Hope you're having fun!

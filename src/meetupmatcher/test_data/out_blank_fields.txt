Dear email1, email4,

you have been matched to a meetup!

Here are your details:

* email1 (email: email1@sdf.x)
* email4 (email: email4@sdf.x)


You are now supposed to meet up in the week specified in the invitation. You can go out for tea, coffee, have lunch, take a walk, or do anything else you like.

Please click "reply all", remove the meetup matcher email address, and suggest a few dates/times to your group (or use slack for the same). Alternatively you can also use a website like https://crab.fit/ to settle on the dates/times (the next iteration of the meetup matcher will likely already have a similar feature included).

Hope you're having fun!

The python package that matched you to your group and generated this email
is available at https://github.com/klieret/meetup-matcher. Fun fact: because the
pseudorandom number generator is seed with the week number, you can
also verify the pseudorandomness of your matched group (though you need the
list of participants for this).
